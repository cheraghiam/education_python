# 🧠 What Is Programming?

**Programming** is the systematic process of designing, formulating, and implementing algorithms that define the behavior of a computational system. These instructions are expressed using a *formal programming language* with precisely defined syntax and semantics.

## 🏗 How Programming Works

At its core, programming involves devising a precise and finite sequence of operations—an **algorithm**—that transforms input data into meaningful output. Modern computing systems follow these operations exactly as defined.

A typical program consists of:

1. **Input** – structured data supplied to the program
2. **Processing** – algorithmic manipulation, computation, and state transitions
3. **Output** – data produced after computation

## 🖥 Programming Languages

Programming languages are formal systems with rules governing structure (**syntax**) and behavior (**semantics**). They serve as a bridge between human logic and machine execution models.

Examples include:

- **Python** – high-level, dynamically typed, excellent for rapid prototyping
- **JavaScript** – event-driven, widely used in web environments
- **C++** – high-performance language with fine-grained memory control
- **Java** – executed on a virtual machine, suitable for large-scale enterprise systems

Despite their differences, all programming languages share the fundamental goal of specifying computable behavior.

## 🔄 Execution Models

### ✔ Interpreted Languages
Executed line-by-line by an interpreter. These languages often provide flexibility and ease of debugging.
Example: **Python**, **JavaScript**

### ✔ Compiled Languages
Translated into machine-level instructions prior to execution, enabling greater speed and efficiency.
Example: **C++**, **Rust**, **Java** (via bytecode and JVM)
