# 🧠 What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions that tell a computer what to do.  
These instructions are written in a *programming language* such as Python, JavaScript, or C++.

## 💡 Why Do We Need Programming?

Computers are powerful machines, but they cannot think on their own.  
Programming allows us to:

- Automate tasks  
- Solve complex problems  
- Build applications (web, mobile, desktop)  
- Create games and interactive systems  
- Analyze data and control hardware

## 🏗 How Programming Works

To understand programming, imagine giving a friend step-by-step instructions.  
Computers work the same way—they follow instructions **exactly** as written.

A program usually contains:

1. **Input** – data the program receives  
2. **Processing** – operations and logic  
3. **Output** – results produced by the program

## 🖥 Programming Languages

A programming language is a formal way to communicate with a computer.  
Some examples include:

- **Python** – simple and readable  
- **JavaScript** – used for web development  
- **C++** – fast and powerful  
- **Java** – widely used in large applications  

Each language has its own rules, but the goal is the same:  
➡️ *to tell the computer what to do.*

## 🔄 Two Types of Languages

### ✔ Interpreted Languages
Run line-by-line using an interpreter.  
Example: **Python**

### ✔ Compiled Languages
Translated into machine code before execution.  
Example: **C++**, **Java**

## 🧪 Example: A Simple Program (Python)

```python
print("Hello, world!")
